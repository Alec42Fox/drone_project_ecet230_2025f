# ECET - 230 - 001 - HMS (Height Maintenance System)
## Goals
* Make a single propelled drone that hovers at a specific height and can get back to that height when outside forces act on it.
## Team Members
* Alec Fox - Programming
* Angelo McNeill - CAD Design
* Cristian D. Garcia S. - PCB Design
## Tools and Technologies
* Fusion 360 - 3D Design
* KiCad - PCB Design
* GitHub - Collaboration and Communication
## Timeline
| Phase | Duration | Description |
| :-------: | :------: | :-------: |
| Research Technology | Week 1 | Get the necessary electronics for the project with breakout boards and datasheets for future PCB design |
| CAD Design and Programming | Week 2 - 3 | Work on the design of the frame and chassis of the drone while working of the programming of the electronics |
| Proof of Concept | Week 4 - 5 | Use breakout boards and code to do testing and debugging |
| Looks-Like Prototype and Further Programming | Week 6 - 7 | Print the frame and chassis and do test to make sure they work well; also some programming on the side |
| PCB Design and Manufacturing | Week 8 - 9 | Make the PCB board that will have all the electronics and also buy it |
| Works-Like Prototype  | Week 10 | Test that the code works as intended |
| Engineering Prototype | Week 11 - 12 | Make the final prototype while testing and debugging; combining the looks-like and works-like prototypes|
